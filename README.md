👋 Hi, I’m @s4ndy

👀 I study the psychological frameworks behind influence, persuasion, and deception in cyber operations. I'm fascinated by human vulnerability, digital footprints, and the shadows we all leave behind. 
🌱 Currently diving into adversarial thinking, OSINT workflows, and ethical hacking tools that weaponize curiosity for good.
💞️ Collaborate with me on red team scenarios, CTFs, psychological exploitation modeling, threat actor behavioral profiling, or... whatever. I like to learn new things. 
📫 How to reach me: I don't know. Figure it out
😄 Pronouns: She/her
⚡ Fun fact: Trust is the ultimate 0day ~~~
